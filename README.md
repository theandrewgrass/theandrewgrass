Hi, I'm Andrew--a software developer at Rakuten Kobo. 📕
I work all around the stack, but I do have a soft spot for the frontend. 
I love to work with JavaScript--React and Web Components in particular. I'm also a big fan of .NET and RavenDB.

I strongly believe in continuous learning and the web changes quickly so I'm always trying to teach myself something new.
I contribute regularly to my personal [blog](https://theandrewgrass.com/), writing about things I've recently learned or am interested in.

## 👨‍💻 What I'm working on
- Building a component library using Web Components
- Constructing Micro-frontends with Module Federation
- Building APIs with GraphQL
